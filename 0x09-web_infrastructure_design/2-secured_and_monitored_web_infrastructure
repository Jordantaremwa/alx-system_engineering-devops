secured and monitored web inrastructure for www.foobar.com

Components and Their Roles:

1. Three Firewalls: Enhance security by controlling and monitoring traffic, safeguarding the infrastructure from potential threats.

2. SSL Certificate for HTTPS: Enables secure and encrypted communication, protecting sensitive data during transmission.

3. Three Monitoring Clients: Proactively track system performance, collect data, and ensure efficient and secure operations.

Key Points:

- Firewalls bolster security and block unauthorized access.
- Serving traffic over HTTPS encrypts data in transit.
- Monitoring detects issues and tracks system performance.
- Agents collect data for monitoring from servers.
- To monitor web server QPS, track incoming request rates.

Issues with this Infrastructure:

1. SSL Termination at Load Balancer: Terminating SSL at the load balancer introduces potential security risks. End-to-end encryption is more secure but adds complexity.

2. Single MySQL Server for Writes: A single MySQL server for writes creates a single point of failure. Implement database clustering and failover mechanisms.

3. Uniform Server Components: Uniform components pose a risk of widespread vulnerabilities. Introduce component diversity to enhance resilience.

This infrastructure ensures security, encrypted traffic, and proactive monitoring, with attention to addressing potential vulnerabilities and emphasizing redundancy.
